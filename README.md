### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Hey there, -->

I'm Kadami, a developer with currently a primary focus in web development. My favorite stack would be using Typescript and a Nextjs/React frontend, with a NextAPI backend using Prisma 2 as the ORM behind a postgresql database, I also find web3 interesting in which using a publicly open state store as the backend brings in many interesting applications and it often does away with having to manage a traditional backend, however I'm flexible to using whatever tools that get the job done.

<br/>

# Tools and Frameworks I'm familiar with

- Javascript
- Typescript
- Node
- React
- Express
- Nextjs
- Figma
- Web3
- Ruby
- Rails

  & Many more JS libs and other languages, I enjoy programming and I'm constantly learning more and more.

# My Projects

Please note the demos are hosted using free solutions and their first load may sometimes take a while after inactivity.

## Web3Playground

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-373047?style=flat&logo=react)
![Web3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-web3-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=ethereum)
![IPFS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-IPFS-284D51?style=flat&logo=ipfs)

This project was made to experiment with the different common aspects in the web3 ecosystem, in the process I learnt how to make a frontend that interacts with a blockchain backend, I also learnt a bit of sol, dived deeper into the IPFS and learnt the Mantine UI lib.

![Postgresql](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Postgresql-262F49?style=flat&logo=postgresql)

The first web dev project I've made putting everything I've learnt from bootcamps and courses into practice, the concept behind it is a productivity suite, with different applets. This project provided a great learning experience that taught me the complexities of modern web developement. Lots of bugs were ran into during the development process and it taught me the importance of structuring projects correctly from the start to save lots of time in the future having to refactor code.

## NFTWishlist

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Typescript-292B69?style=flat&logo=TypeScript)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-373047?style=flat&logo=react)
![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express-142044?style=flat&logo=express)
![Mongo](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-1C3E1C?style=flat&logo=Mongodb)

This app is a basic wishlist that's easily shareable with a url code, it's also lockable so only those authed can modify it. My main purpose behind this application was to learn and practically apply Typescript in a project, I opted for traditional react and express over nextJs to also brige the gap between using Next's built in API vs express. My takeway from this project was mainly once I've used typescript, I'd rather not go back to just plain javascript as even writing a bit more code saves a whole lot more time having to debug code later that TS could just pick up on earlier.

## SportsClo [Work In Progress 75%]

![Javascript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Javascript-5A5A37?style=flat&logo=Javascript)
![Nextjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NextJS-303030?style=flat&logo=next.js)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-373047?style=flat&logo=react)
![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Redux-764ABC?style=flat&logo=redux)
![Mongo](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-1C3E1C?style=flat&logo=Mongodb)

The goal of this application was to make a functioning mock up of a sporting equipment E-Commerce store, it's almost completed however still requires many UX adjustments and is still a work in progress, most things are already functioning besides filtering, I've halted progress on this after learning Typescript, I may return to finish it off in the future.

# Future Endeavors

In my spare time I'd like to familiarize myself with other aspects of programming outside of web development, probably pick up a language that's more lower level than JS/TS like Rust, and I'd also be interested in diving deeper into languages like Sol.
